* Fixed a race condition bug in sthread_preempt.c that could cause process
  to terminate with "Alarm clock" message if preemption period set too
  low.
* Fixed (I hope) strange SIGALRM signal behavior where signals would stop
  being delivered after some time because the itimer would not reset properly
  when the preemption period was set very low. Note that this was only
  changed for x86_64, not i386.
* Renamed "clock_tick()" (etc.) to "timer_tick()" (etc.).
* Added error-checking on signal-related system calls in sthread_preempt.c.
* (snowden) Code cleanup and removal of PowerPC support.
* Bumped version to 2.01.

* Added support for x86_64 architecture in stack switching code and related
  files.
* Made adjustments to preemption code to work on x86_64 and modern Linux
  distributions.
* Updated / removed various automake and autoconf files to work with
  current versions of these tools. The following page was helpful:
  http://stackoverflow.com/ questions/3096989/libtool-version-mismatch-error
* Added numerous clarifying comments and made other various changes.
* Added subdirectories in cse451git repository for solutions and grading
  scripts.
* Bumped version to 2.00.

* fixed small bug in sthread_preempt.c.  Bug was caught by Daniel Suskin and
  Eli Williams.
     old:  it.it_interval.tv_usec = period;
     new:  it.it_interval.tv_usec = period % 1000000;
* Bumped version to 1.31.

* Hacked around with configure.in and Makefile.am to
  try and make them portable across versions of
  autoconf/automake. Failed, and set the required autoconf
  to 2.57 instead.
* Removed GNU Pth derived thread contexts; replaced with
  assembly to switch stacks on i386 and PowerPC.
* Made use of native pthreads a compile time, instead of
  run time, option. Some pthreads libraries expect a
  pthread record at the base of the stack, even if the
  pthreads have not been initialized. This breaks
  the user-level threads.
* Bumped version to 1.10.
