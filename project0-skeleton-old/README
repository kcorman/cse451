To compile the skeleton files, run one of these commands in this directory:
    make queuetest
    make hashtest
    make all

The test files as distributed may not compile or run correctly; it is your
job to fix the bugs and implement the functions so that they will! The
provided tests verify only small aspects of the functionality of the data
structures, so you should be sure to write additional tests yourself.

The provided clint.py script can be used to check your code for style.
Please make an attempt not to introduce any new style violations; this
will make your code more readable both to you and to the TAs.
